# PosterAlgorithm
Poster Algorithm from XV IT Olimpics, "Plakatowanie" algorithm, with own implementation.

Two different approaches has been implemented:

1. From Left to Right - with applying Posters from Highest to lowest.
  This implementation is only ~20 lines of code, very fast, 
  simple data, one method oriented

2. From Top - To Bottom
  This implementation is ~120 lines of code. Not so fast, used Nested Lists  (List<List<int>>)
  Easy to implement more nested data, also easy to reorganize, and add more features
